How to change the version of the pack:
    1. Unarchive the songpack;
    2. Delete ReactiveMusic.yaml (don't panic, there's its copy here named latest_version.yaml);
    3. Copy yaml file of the version you want to use from songpack-versions folder;
    4. Past it in the place where ReactiveMusic.yaml was (in the reactive-music-off-1.1 folder);
    5. Rename the file to ReactiveMusic.yaml;
    6. Load new version in Reactive Music settings.


All of the versions:
    20yy-mm_version-name      - presets for all versions of Minecraft where new music was added
    latest_version            - preset for the latest Minecraft version (same as 2025-05_1.21.6)
    C418-only                 - only songs from C418 are present (same as 2018-06_1.13)
    old-main-menu-songs-only  - removes any songs from the main menu except of ones made by C418 specifically for main menu


You can have different versions installed at the same time because they all have different names and version number.
